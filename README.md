And here is the shortest README.md ever:
```bash
make
```

Okay okay...

So in `/src` folder you find a markdown file named `maind.md` and inside it is where you write the content of your cv.
Then there is this `style.css` file where you can style it!

When you run `make build` it will build the image needed to build the Resume.
Then you can run `make html` for an html version or `make pdf` for the pdf version!

Or you can do the sort version and run `make` and have all the things.
