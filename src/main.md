## Journey

2013-2016 <br/> <sub>(3 years)</sub>
:   **Artesis Plantijn**: Bachelor (Ba) in de toegepaste informatica

<br/>

2016-2016 <br/> <sub>(5 months)</sub>
: **10to1**: Internship

: During my internship at 10to1, I worked with Ruby on Rails to help rework an old application. The team was fantastic, and the experience really sparked my passion for programming. It also taught me some useful lessons, like how Caps Lock should be remapped to Control, how mechanical keyboards are actually pretty cool, and that macOS might not just be for snobs.

2016-2018 <br/> <sub>(2 years, 1 month)</sub>
: **Beeple**: Full-stack developer

: At Beeple, I worked with Ruby on Rails to build various features, including custom fields, customizable tables, and filters. The frontend was built using SSR, limited by ES5, so we used jQuery and CoffeeScript to navigate those constraints. We also worked with a PostgreSQL database to manage data within a large codebase. During my time there, I was persuaded to try Emacs and learned to appreciate the efficiency of mouseless programming.

2018-2020 <br/> <sub>(2 years, 1 month)</sub>
: **Solvace**: Full-stack developer

: At Solvace, I continued my journey in the Ruby world, adding MySQL to my skillset and getting my first introduction to SPAs using Ember. The Ember app was being upgraded from a very old version to the latest one, step by step. I worked on building new features, like custom fields (again!) and APIs for third-party integrations, while managing a larger codebase.

2020-2025 <br/> <sub>(4 years 7 months)</sub>
: **PAU**: Full-stack developer

: At Pau, I made the switch from Ruby to TypeScript, using Express, Node, and React with Redux to contribute to a larger application. I worked on adding new features, though this time there were no custom fields. I also dove deeper into SQL to improve the performance of data fetching. In the later years, my focus shifted to smaller applications using Nestjs and react, and the challenge became being able to switch between them seamlessly, which led me to learn Docker for local development. I also started exploring CI/CD, setting up GitHub Actions for testing and deployments. Along the way, I had to give up Emacs since I couldn't get the LSP working, briefly tried VSCode, but ultimately ended up with the best editor... nvim.

2025-present
: **As built**: Full-stack developer

: At Asbuilt, I worked on a long-term project using NestJS with a React SPA, along with Prisma, Zod, and Jotai. My work involved building new features, fixing bugs, and contributing to the overall improvement of the application.
